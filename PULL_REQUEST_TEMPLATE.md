#### Single-line Summary
**J, Harry and ED pair programmed on this project, we had a little hiccup when we realized we were not working off of the original fork from the class repository, but a fork from that fork.  We moved files around to make submission into the class repo easier, and then we did the markdown files, the project took about four days.**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. We started by pair programming to get the program working properly.
  2. We then started by going through the user stories and the CRUD testing, programming each part one at a time.
  3. We finished up by doing the reviews, comments, and markdown files.
